# Blockchain

Simple Blockchain implementation written in Python.

Understanding blockchain isn't easy. At least it wasn't for me. I had to go through number of frustrations due to too few funcional examples of how this technology works. And I like learning by doing so if you do the same, allow me to guide you and by the end you will have a functioning Blockchain with a solid idea of how they work.

### Before you get started..

Remember that a blockchain is an immutable, sequential chain of records called Blocks. They can contain transactions, files or any data you like, really. But the important thing is that theyâ€™re chained together using hashes.

### What is needed?

Make sure that you have Python 3.6+ installed (along with pip) and you will also need Flask and Requests library.

```sh
$ pip3 install -r requirements
```

You will also need an HTTP client like Postman or curl. But anything will do.

# Step 1: Building a Blockchain

So what does a block look like?

Each block has an index, timestamp, transactions, proof (more on that later) and a hash of the previous transaction.

Here is an example of what a single Block looks like:

```python
block = {
    'index': 1,
    'timestamp': 1506092455,
    'transactions': [
        {
            'sender': "852714982as982341a4b27ee00",
            'recipient': "a77f5cdfa2934hv25c7c7da5df1f",
            'amount': 5,
        }
    ],
    'proof': 323454734020,
    'previous_hash': "2cf24dba5fb0a3202h2025c25e7304249898"
}
```

### Represenging a Blockchain

We'll create a blockchain class whose constructor creates a list to store our blockchain and another to store transactions.  Here is how the Class will look like:

```python
class BlockChain(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.chain = []
        self.current_transactions = []

    @staticmethod
    def hash(block):
        pass

    def new_block(self):
        pass

    @property
    def last_block(self):
        return self.chain[-1]
```
This Blockchain class is responsible for managing the chain. It will store transactions and have helper functions.

The new_block method will create a new block and adds it on the chain and returns the last block in the chain.

The last_block method will return the last block in the chain.

Each block contains the hash and the hash of the previous block. This is what gives blockchains it's immutability - i.e. if anyone attack this, all subsequent blocks will be corrupt.

It's the core idea of blockchains. :)


### Adding transactions to the block

We will need some way of adding transactions to the block.

```python
class Blockchain(object):
    ...
    def new_transaction(self, sender, recipient, amount):
        self.current_transactions.append({
            'sender': sender,
            'recipient': recipient,
            'amount': amount,
        })
        return self.last_block['index'] + 1
```

The new_transaction returns index of the block which will be added to current_transactions and is next one to be mined..

# Step 4: Consensus

# Step 5: Transaction verification

For this we will be using Python NaCl to generate a public/private signing key pair: private.key, public.key which need to be generated before runtime.

We will employ the cryptography using the Public-key signature standards X.509 for Public Key Certificates.

For more information on the X.509 please refer to the X.509 documentation.  More on that here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509
