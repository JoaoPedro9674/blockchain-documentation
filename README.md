# Blockchain

Simple Blockchain implementation written in Python.

Understanding blockchain isn't easy. At least it wasn't for me. I had to go through number of frustrations due to too few funcional examples of how this technology works. And I like learning by doing so if you do the same, allow me to guide you and by the end you will have a functioning Blockchain with a solid idea of how they work.

### Before you get started..

Remember that a blockchain is an immutable, sequential chain of records called Blocks. They can contain transactions, files or any data you like, really. But the important thing is that theyâ€™re chained together using hashes.

### What is needed?

Make sure that you have Python 3.6+ installed (along with pip) and you will also need Flask and Requests library.

```sh
$ pip3 install -r requirements
```

You will also need an HTTP client like Postman or curl. But anything will do.
