# Blockchain

Simple Blockchain implementation written in Python.

Understanding blockchain isn't easy. At least it wasn't for me. I had to go through number of frustrations due to too few funcional examples of how this technology works. And I like learning by doing so if you do the same, allow me to guide you and by the end you will have a functioning Blockchain with a solid idea of how they work.

### Before you get started..

Remember that a blockchain is an immutable, sequential chain of records called Blocks. They can contain transactions, files or any data you like, really. But the important thing is that theyâ€™re chained together using hashes.

### What is needed?

Make sure that you have Python 3.6+ installed (along with pip) and you will also need Flask and Requests library.

```sh
$ pip3 install -r requirements
```

You will also need an HTTP client like Postman or curl. But anything will do.

# Step 1: Building a Blockchain

So what does a block look like?

Each block has an index, timestamp, transactions, proof (more on that later) and a hash of the previous transaction.

Here is an example of what a single Block looks like:

```python
block = {
    'index': 1,
    'timestamp': 1506092455,
    'transactions': [
        {
            'sender': "852714982as982341a4b27ee00",
            'recipient': "a77f5cdfa2934hv25c7c7da5df1f",
            'amount': 5,
        }
    ],
    'proof': 323454734020,
    'previous_hash': "2cf24dba5fb0a3202h2025c25e7304249898"
}
```

### Represenging a Blockchain

We'll create a blockchain class whose constructor creates a list to store our blockchain and another to store transactions.  Here is how the Class will look like:

```python
class BlockChain(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.chain = []
        self.current_transactions = []

    @staticmethod
    def hash(block):
        pass

    def new_block(self):
        pass

    @property
    def last_block(self):
        return self.chain[-1]
```
This Blockchain class is responsible for managing the chain. It will store transactions and have helper functions.

The new_block method will create a new block and adds it on the chain and returns the last block in the chain.

The last_block method will return the last block in the chain.

Each block contains the hash and the hash of the previous block. This is what gives blockchains it's immutability - i.e. if anyone attack this, all subsequent blocks will be corrupt.

It's the core idea of blockchains. :)


### Adding transactions to the block

We will need some way of adding transactions to the block.

```python
class Blockchain(object):
    ...
    def new_transaction(self, sender, recipient, amount):
        self.current_transactions.append({
            'sender': sender,
            'recipient': recipient,
            'amount': amount,
        })
        return self.last_block['index'] + 1
```

The new_transaction returns index of the block which will be added to current_transactions and is next one to be mined..

### Creating new blocks

In addition to creating the genesis block in our constructor, we will also need to flesh out methods for the new_block(), add_new_transaction() and hash().


```python
import hashlib
import json
import time

class BlockChain(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.chain = []
        self.current_transactions = []
        # create the genesis block
        self.new_block(previous_hash=1, proof=100)

    @staticmethod
    def hash(block):
        # hashes a block
        # also make sure that the transactions are ordered otherwise we will have insonsistent hashes!
        block_string = json.dumps(block, sort_keys=True).encode()
        return hashlib.sha256(block_string).hexdigest()

    def new_block(self, proof, previous_hash=None):
        # creates a new block in the blockchain
        block = {
            'index': len(self.chain)+1,
            'timestamp': time.time(),
            'transactions': self.current_transactions,
            'proof': proof,
            'previous_hash': previous_hash or self.hash(self.chain[-1]),
        }
        # reset the current list of transactions
        self.current_transactions = []
        self.chain.append(block)
        return block

    @property
    def last_block(self):
        # returns last block in the chain
        return self.chain[-1]

    def new_transaction(self, sender, recipient, amount):
        # adds a new transaction into the list of transactions
        # these transactions go into the next mined block
        self.current_transactions.append({
            "sender":sender,
            "recient":recipient,
            "data":amount,
        })
        return int(self.last_block['index'])+1
```

Once our block is initiated, we need to feed it with the genesis block (a block with no predecessors). We will also need to add "a proof of work" to our genesis block which is the result of mining.

At this point, we're nearly done representing our blockchain.

So lets talk about how the new blocks are created, forged and mined. :)

### Understanding Proof of Work

A proof of work algorithm are how new Blocks are created or mined on the blockchain.

The goal is to discover a number that solves a problem.

The number must be difficult and resources consuming to find but super quick and easy to verify.

This is the core idea of Proof of Work.  :)


So lets work out some stupid-shit math problem that we are going to require to be solved in order for a block to be mined.

Lets say that hash of some integer ```x``` multiplied by another ```y``` must always end in 0.  So, as an example, the ```hash(x * y) = 4b4f4b4f54...0```.

Lets take this by an example and fix the ```x = 10```.

```python
from hashlib import sha256

x = 10
y = 0 # we do not know what y should be yet

while sha256(f'{x*y}'.encode()).hexdigest()[-1] != "0":
    y+1

print(f'The solution is y = {y})
```

The solution in this case is ```y = 42``` since it procuced hash ```0```.

```python
hash(5 * 21) = "12523e93743e8a2814h21k23a2bb3554b565e3600155e860"
```

In the Bitcoin world, the Proof of Work algorithm is called Hashcash.  And it's not any different from the example above.  It's the very algorithm that miners race to solve in order to create a new block.  The difficulty is of course determined by the number of the characters searched for in the string. In our example we simplified it by defining that the resultant hash must end in 0 to make the whole thing in our case quicker and less resource intensive but this is how it works really.
The miners are rewarded for finding a solution by receiving a coin. In a transaction. There are many opinions on effectiness of this but this is how it works. And it really is that simple and this way the network is able to easily verify their solution. :)

** Editor's note: 4b-4f-4b-4f-54 in the example above in hex translates to = "kokot" lol. :D

For this we will be using Python NaCl to generate a public/private signing key pair: private.key, public.key which need to be generated before runtime. We will employ the cryptography using the Public-key signature standards X.509 for Public Key Certificates.
